        <h2>About the Candid Wedding</h2>
        <p>
          Candid wedding photography is all about real moments and genuine emotions. It captures
          laughter, happy tears, nervous smiles, and spontaneous reactions as they naturally
          unfold—without posing or interruption. Every wedding is filled with unscripted moments
          that tell the true story of the day. From stolen glances and playful banter to emotional
          hugs and joyful celebrations, candid photography preserves the essence of love and
          togetherness in its purest form. We believe the most beautiful memories are created when
          people are simply themselves. With a discreet and artistic approach, we capture these
          fleeting moments, turning them into timeless photographs that let you relive your wedding
          exactly as it happened.

          <h3>Genuine Emotions</h3>
          <p>
            Genuine emotions are the most beautiful part of every celebration. They appear in
            unplanned moments — a tearful smile, a burst of laughter, a warm embrace — capturing
            feelings that words often cannot express. These emotions are real, raw, and deeply
            personal. They reflect love, connection, and the joy of being surrounded by people who
            truly matter. When preserved naturally, they become timeless memories that can be felt
            again and again.

          <h3>Natural Photography</h3>
          <p>
            Natural photography is about capturing moments as they truly are — honest, effortless,
            and full of life. It relies on real light, real emotions, and real connections, without
            forced poses or artificial expressions. By allowing moments to unfold naturally, we
            preserve the beauty of authenticity. Subtle glances, quiet smiles, and spontaneous
            interactions come together to tell a genuine story that feels true and timeless.

          <h3>Memories Preserved</h3>
          <p>
            Memories are fleeting, but the emotions behind them deserve to last forever. Every
            smile, tear, and shared moment holds a story worth remembering. Through thoughtful and
            heartfelt photography, these moments are preserved just as they happened — honest,
            emotional, and full of life. They become more than images; they turn into reminders of
            love, joy, and togetherness.
